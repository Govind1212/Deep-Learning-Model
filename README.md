"# Deep-Learning-Model" 
Proposed a method for automatically detecting yoga poses in real-time or the recorded videos. 
The dataset can be found at https://archive.org/details/YogaVid. 
To detect all landmark points in the video frame by frame, we used Mediapipe. 
A CSV file was created for all four folders, which contained asanas such as Padmasana, Tadasana, Trikonasana, and Vrikshasana. 
This process was repeated for all four folders. 
To make the prediction, we used the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to train the model.
